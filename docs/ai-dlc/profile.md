# The governing initiative. A fresh session reads this first, opens that roadmap,
# and resumes from its first unchecked slice — never from memory of what seemed
# next. This field was missing entirely until 2026-08-18, which is why the boot
# checklist in .claude/CLAUDE.md kept pointing at a key that was not there.

  test:  ./scripts/verify.sh          # leaf: backend pytest + boot probe → "BACKEND VERIFY OK" (never two at once)
  lint:  cd backend && ruff check . && ruff format --check . ; cd frontend && npm run lint   # ruff + Biome

hotspots:
  - frontend/src/styles/tokens.css    # design tokens — single owner per pass
  - frontend/src/styles/app.css       # all component CSS
  - frontend/src/App.tsx              # shell, hash routing, all view state
  - frontend/src/api/types.ts         # hand-maintained FE API types
  - backend/app/domain/grading.py     # grading orchestration (was mis-listed as services/grading.py until 2026-09-18)
  - backend/alembic/versions/         # migrations — sequential, never parallel-owned

invariants:
  - domain core backend/app/domain/ has no web/DB imports (test-enforced)
  - results are frequency + EV, never boolean
  - grading stays behind the one async StrategyProvider
  - strategy lives in versioned content/ data, not code
  - CSS values come from design tokens only (no raw hex/px outside tokens.css)
  - WCAG AA contrast + visible focus, both themes
  - every schema change ships an Alembic migration
  - spot_signature() is frozen (changing it orphans SRS history)
  - FE types hand-maintained in frontend/src/api/types.ts (schema.d.ts is unwired)
  - EVs labeled approximate until solver phase

## Resume

updated:      2026-09-25 (bot-realism-6max roadmap approved) · commit: see branch docs/bot-realism-6max-roadmap · log-entry: "2026-09-25 — Bot realism at 6-max roadmap approved; flywheel closed"
position:     Active initiative is now bot-realism-6max (`roadmap/bot-realism-6max.md`). The phone
              work is merged and owner-verified in landscape (#236, #237), and stacks now carry
              over between hands (#239). The owner played 200 Challenge hands at 6-max (session
              `4b35736f`), which closed the flywheel's last box. The owner's notes flag the LAG
              and the calling station; a blind review of the same hands is at
              `reviews/bot-review-200-hands-2026-09-25.md`.
merged:       #236, #237, #238, #239. The roadmap docs PR is not merged yet.
awaiting John: (a) merge the roadmap docs PR; (b) fix the always-on agent — macOS blocks it from
              reading ~/Documents (grant /bin/bash Full Disk Access, or move the repo); (c) `git
              worktree prune` to clear stale worktree records.
authorized:   nothing standing. The owner merges every PR; Claude never merges.
next action:  `/ai-org:spec` for M1 (the 6-max baseline measurement), with R1 (stack-depth
              research) alongside. M1b, then M2 (the LAG retune plus the board-straight bug fix at
              both table sizes), follow in order.
