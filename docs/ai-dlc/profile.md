# The governing initiative. A fresh session reads this first, opens that roadmap,
# and resumes from its first unchecked slice — never from memory of what seemed
# next. This field was missing entirely until 2026-08-18, which is why the boot
# checklist in .claude/CLAUDE.md kept pointing at a key that was not there.

hotspots:
  - frontend/src/styles/tokens.css    # design tokens — single owner per pass
  - frontend/src/styles/app.css       # all component CSS
  - frontend/src/App.tsx              # shell, hash routing, all view state
  - frontend/src/api/types.ts         # hand-maintained FE API types
  - backend/app/domain/grading.py     # grading orchestration (was mis-listed as services/grading.py until 2026-09-18)
  - backend/alembic/versions/         # migrations — sequential, never parallel-owned

invariants:
  - domain core backend/app/domain/ has no web/DB imports (test-enforced)
  - results are frequency + EV, never boolean
  - grading stays behind the one async StrategyProvider
  - strategy lives in versioned content/ data, not code
  - CSS values come from design tokens only (no raw hex/px outside tokens.css)
  - WCAG AA contrast + visible focus, both themes
  - every schema change ships an Alembic migration
  - spot_signature() is frozen (changing it orphans SRS history)
  - FE types hand-maintained in frontend/src/api/types.ts (schema.d.ts is unwired)
  - EVs labeled approximate until solver phase

## Resume

updated:      2026-09-27 (M1b built, reviewed, PR #243 opened) · commit: 053ac67 · log-entry: "2026-09-27 — M1b table-size settings built; PR #243"
position:     M1 merged (#242). M1b (bot settings that can differ by table size) is BUILT, ticked in the
              roadmap, and open as PR #243 on `feat/m1b-table-size-settings`. 6-max override files
              (`content/personas/six_max/<bot>.json`, none shipped) merge at 6 seats only. The golden
              fingerprint of every bot decision is unchanged at both sizes. make check green (backend
              2419, frontend 135). Ledger `ledger/m1b-table-size-settings.md`: 20 findings, none open.
merged:       #236–#242. PR #243 (M1b) open, not merged.
known issues: `scripts/verify.sh` boot probe flakes ~2.8% (needs a vs_4bet drill spot in 80 random
              draws; 4.35% of the pool). Unrelated to M1b; re-run clears it.
awaiting John: (a) merge PR #243; (b) Gemini login (`agy` once in a plain terminal) — M1b's reviews were
              Claude-only because Codex cannot reach its service and Gemini auth timed out; (c) older:
              the always-on agent fix, `git worktree prune`.
authorized:   nothing standing. M1b's --auto-build authorization is spent now that its PR is open.
              M2 and R1 each need their own spec and approval.
next action:  after the merge: `/ai-org:spec M2 — retune the LAG at 6-max` (its spec should use the
              six_max/ override path and re-pin the golden constants with a per-hand diff report).
